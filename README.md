# Saasty.io

[Saasty](http://saasty.io) is an on-line web application building platform. We have developed it to be user-friendly and operable by non-developers. At the core of our
application builder. To make the generated application code readable and clear for our users who are brave enough to peek under the hood, we have developed several
open-source frameworks.

Saasty itself and any applications generated by Saasty will depend on the following code. If you spot any problems with the apps, you can submit a bug-report or even
take matters into your own hands and give back to our community.

## Backend frameworks

Applications generated by Saasty can work with SQL and NoSQL databases. They also integrate with different libraries which are working hard to protect and keep
your data safe.

 - ATK Data  https://github.com/atk4/data

## Frontend frameworks

The user-interface of apps produced by Saasty relies on by open-source contributors:

 - ATK UI  https://github.com/atk4/ui
 - Fomantic-UI  http://www.fomantic-ui.com/

## Integrations

Several other frameworks are used and deserve some credit:

 - Log-in and Authentication  https://github.com/atk4/login
